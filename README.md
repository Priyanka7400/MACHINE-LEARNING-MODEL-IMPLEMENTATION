# MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-IMPLEMENTATION
## Project Description
This project implements a predictive machine learning model to classify email/SMS messages as *Spam* or *Not Spam (Ham)* using *Scikit-Learn*.  
The model uses text processing techniques and the *Naive Bayes algorithm* for classification.
