# MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-IMPLEMENTATION
## Project Description
This project implements a predictive machine learning model to classify email/SMS messages as *Spam* or *Not Spam (Ham)* using *Scikit-Learn*.  
The model uses text processing techniques and the *Naive Bayes algorithm* for classification.

---

## Objective
To build a predictive model that can accurately detect spam messages from a given dataset.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Dataset
The SMS Spam Collection Dataset is used in this project.  
It contains labeled messages as
- ham → Not Spam
- spam → Spam

Dataset source:
- Public SMS spam dataset (loaded directly via URL)

---

## Machine Learning Model
- *Algorithm:* Multinomial Naive Bayes  
- *Feature Extraction:* CountVectorizer

---

##  Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

*Achieved Accuracy:* ~99%

---

## How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
